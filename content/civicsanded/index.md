### Roundtable Politics
Building on experiences with organizations and causes that promoted civil discourse on campus, some wonderful people are coming together to help spread civil discourse, civic engagement, and citizenship development throughout colleges across the country.

### Political Science Research
My undergraduate capstone focused on using machine learning to identify potential pork-barrel legislation. The capstone produced a preliminary model and paper which can be [found here](https://digitalcommons.dartmouth.edu/dujpew/vol1/iss4/7/).

Work to create a better model with more automated data pipelines is ongoing.
