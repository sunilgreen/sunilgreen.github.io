### Learning Bangla as an ABCD
I'm currently learning Bangla, a beautiful language which I wished I had learned when I was younger. Here's a list of resources, some of which I found and some of which I put together which have helped me as I learn the langauge:

- [Bangla Alphabet Quizlet]()
- [Bangla Alphabet Pronunciation]()
- [Bangla Simple Vocab Quizlet]()
- [Bangla More Advanced Vocab Quizlet]()
- [Bangla-Tangla Website (Great for verb conjugations and dictionary)]()
