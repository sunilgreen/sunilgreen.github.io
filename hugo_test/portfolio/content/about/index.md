Hello world.                           

 On here you'll find a bit of everything that I like to put on the internet. If something sparks your interest, please reach out! I always love getting know other cool humans.  
   

***Some things included:***  
  

  - My professional resume 
  - Relevant work in the tech industry
  - Passionate work I do in the areas of civics and education 
  - Some fun projects (and a bit more, click the "Fun tab")

***What I'm working on:***

  - A [nonprofit that promotes civil discourse](https://roundtablepolitics.org/) 
  - Research that combines computer science & social science

***What I hope to add***  
  
  - Digital art (coming soon, not NFTs I promise) 
  - Volunteer work
   

I hope you find something here that's somewhat intersting, but I know not everyone is into tech, or civics, or the randomness and absuridty of our digital age. Nevertheless, if you think I could help on a project or iniative you're passionate about, my inbox is always open.
